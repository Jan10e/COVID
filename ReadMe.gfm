# COVID_SIR

COVID_SIR is a collection of SIR models used for COVID-19 modelling by [RxCOVEA](https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/mishra/RXCovea.html).

A couple of other resources are used. Although this code is adjusted from the original, please, refer to these resources when you use
- [Main_SEIR-L_IN.jl](https://github.com/timueh/PandemicModeling)
- [3blue1brown_COVID.jl](https://gist.github.com/swairshah/b90d6f5dfc028d1bf8162ce363e3d0b4)


## Usage

These scripts are coded in Julia. To work in the editor, use the `Main_*.jl` scripts and the indicated function `NAME.jl` in the script itself (see `# Functions`).

Scripts that are called `NAME.ipynb` are coded up in Jupyter Notebook. You have to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to be able to use this.
